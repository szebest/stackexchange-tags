# Stackexchange tags

[Live demo](https://stackexchange-tags.netlify.app/)

This project allows the user to browse the Stackexchange tags data available from the [Stackexchange API](https://api.stackexchange.com/).
The application allows to sort the data by:
 - popular
 - activity (last created post with given tag)
 - name
User is able to pick one of the stackexchange sites to get the data from (i.e Stackoverflow, Serverfault etc).
